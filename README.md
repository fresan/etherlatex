etherlatex
==========

Server scripts that enable collaborative browser-based editing and display of Latex documents using Etherpad.

Further information is available here http://pendicular.net/etherlatex.php at the moment.

Once set up this is already useful. There is plenty of room for improvements. In particular the following improvements would be useful:

- Browser-based creation of new latex documents.
- A secure browser-based file upload function for pdf figures and style files.
- User authentication on a per document basis.
- Latex syntax highlighting (in Etherpad).
