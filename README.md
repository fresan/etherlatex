etherlatex
==========

Scripts for browser-based collaborative editing and display of Latex documents using Etherpad.

Further information is available here http://pendicular.net/etherlatex.php .

There is plenty of room for improvements. In particular the following improvements would be useful:

- Automatic creation of new documents.
- A secure file upload function for pdf figures and style files.
- User authentication on a per document basis.
- Latex syntax highlighting (in Etherpad).
